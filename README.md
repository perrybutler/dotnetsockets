.NET Sockets
============

Client/server chat/packet engine using asynchronous .NET sockets.

This was developed as a sub-component to a personal project (Carcassonne board game in .NET) which I have since decided would be more suited to a website platform.

Using OOP principles, the idea is to offer a base packet object which can be inherited, allowing for custom packets that encapsulate any data structure using serialization, and broadcasting any messages from the server back to one or more clients.

May be useful as a learning tool or starting point for multiplayer video game programming in Windows.
