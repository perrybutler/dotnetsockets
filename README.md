.NET Sockets
============

Client/server chat/packet engine using asynchronous .NET sockets.

This was developed as a sub-component to a personal project which I have since decided would be more suited to a website platform (Carcassonne clone in .NET).

May be useful as a learning tool or starting point for multiplayer video game programming in Windows.
